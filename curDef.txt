Description of this Script: This is an electronic compass, that gets all of its telemetry from
a remote server called signalK. SignalKiosk initiates a tcp connection with this server via standalone
process xvz() then periodically request telemetry to update the display held in a signalKiosk device.
In my application, this will be an electronic compass in a sailboat steering-post/binnacle.


Cant integrate the use of getSigKcommand; it will sort of operate from main, i.e., Callxyz()
But when called by xvz()....

Misuse of pipe in get SigKcommand; i think
